# PLASMA 123 Architecture
This document describes the low-level implementation of PLASMA. It is not necessary to know how PLASMA is implemented to write PLASMA programs, but understanding how the virtual machine operates can give you insight on how certain operations are carried out and how to write optimal PLASMA code. It *is* a requirement to understand when interfacing to native 6502 code.
