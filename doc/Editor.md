      WELCOME TO THE PLASMA EDITOR!
      =============================

FIRST THINGS FIRST:
TO NAVIGATE, USE THE ARROW KEYS.  ON THE
APPLE ][:

  CTRL-K = UP
  CTRL-J = DOWN.

TO JUMP AROUND THE TEXT FILE USE:

  CTRL-W = JUMP UP
  CTRL-Z = JUMP DOWN
  CTRL-A = JUMP LEFT
  CTRL-S = JUMP RIGHT

  CTRL-Q = JUMP BEGINNING
  CTRL-E = JUMP END

THE 'ESCAPE' KEY WILL PUT YOU IN COMMAND

ENTERING 'Q' AND 'RETURN'. YOU CAN ALSO
RETURN TO THE EDITOR BY JUST PRESSING
'RETURN'.

-------

THE PLASMA EDITOR IS A SIMPLE TEXT
EDITOR FOR ENTERING AND MANIPULATING
TEXT AND SOURCE CODE FILES.  THE EDITOR
ONLY SUPPORTS 40 COLUMN TEXT ALTHOUGH
LINES CAN BE UP TO 79 CHARACTERS LONG.
THE  SCREEN WILL SCROLL HORIZONTALLY
AS THE CURSOR MOVES. THERE IS 16K OF
MEMORY FOR THE TEXT BUFFER.

IT HAS TWO MODES, COMMAND AND EDIT.

  EDIT COMMANDS:

    LEFT ARROW  = MOVE CHAR LEFT
    RIGHT ARROW = MOVE CHAR RIGHT
    UP ARROW    = MOVE LINE UP
    DOWN ARROW  = MOVE LINE DOWN
    CTRL-K      = MOVE LINE UP
    CTRL-J      = MOVE LINE DOWN
    CTRL-A      = JUMP LEFT
    CTRL-S      = JUMP RIGHT
    CTRL-W      = JUMP UP
    CTRL-Z      = JUMP DOWN
    CTRL-Q      = JUMP BEGIN
    CTRL-E      = JUMP END
    CTRL-D      = DELETE CHAR
    CTRL-X      = DELETE LINE
    CTRL-V      = COPY DELETED LINE
    CTRL-O      = OPEN NEW LINE
    CTRL-F      = OPEN A FOLLOWING NEW LINE
    CTRL-T      = JOIN LINES
    CTRL-I      = TOGGLE INSERT/OVERWRITE

  APPLE ][ FEATURES:

    SHIFT-M   = ]

    CTRL-B    = |

    WITH THE SHIFT-KEY MOD ON AN

    inverse.  This is the default.

  Apple //e AND //c FEATURES:

    THE 'CLOSED-APPLE' KEY WILL MODIFY
    THE ARROW KEYS INTO THEIR JUMP
    EQUIVALENTS. IT WILL ALSO MODIFY
    THE 'RETURN' KEY TO OPEN UP A LINE,
    JUST LIKE CTRL-F.
